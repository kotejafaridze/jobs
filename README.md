# My HTML/CSS Project

Welcome to my HTML/CSS project! This project showcases my skills in building static web pages using HTML and CSS. It's a simple yet elegant project that demonstrates my understanding of responsive design, modern UI/UX principles, and clean code practices.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have created a collection of web pages that serve as a portfolio website. The project includes the following pages:

- Home Page: Introduces myself and provides a brief overview of my skills and experience.
- About Page: Provides more detailed information about my background, education, and interests.
- All Jobs Page: Displays a comprehensive list of available job opportunities.
- Job Detail Page: Shows detailed information about a specific job listing, including job title, company name, job description, and application instructions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Used for creating the structure and content of the web pages.
- CSS3: Used for styling the web pages and making them visually appealing.
- Responsive Design: Ensured that the web pages are optimized for different screen sizes and devices.
